Negative Reviews (Top 3):
Rating: 5/5 | Date: 2024-02-04
Content: It would be so nice if I could set the units in the app. I use my phone in English but I leave in a km county and now the app shows me miles instead of kilometers.

Rating: 1/5 | Date: 2022-01-20
Content: At first it was not possible to register, the app crashed constantly to the start page. Then, eventually, the program started working, more or less stably for a couple of months, but now it crashes several times a day. It seems from reviews that not only I have this issue with the application. What amazes me is the lack of action by developers.

Rating: 3/5 | Date: 2021-05-10
Content: Please add the option to change units to metric, and I'm missing eDrive statistics that was available in the BMW Connected app.

Content: the app says that the car is unlocked even though it is locked. I think there might be a problem with the app. worked fine before but after I got it the car checked, the app is not working properly

Content: App must be programmed by a cheap company. Tyre pressure is still only visible in psi, not in bar. The logging out issue is still present every once and awhile. Credentials are required even after setting a pin. Even Renault has a better app then BMW.

Content: Great app, can see cars location, status, fuel, milage, vin, and even do remote functions like fan circulation, lock the car, flash the lights etc. Best part is its all free

Content: App not functioning perfectly. After the connection that takes place without any problems, it does not update the vehicle's status and real-time position, producing a late and fake remote check. I believe the developers can resolve this problem if it depends on them.

Content: I previously used the app on my iphone. Then I installed the app on my Google pixel 7 as I recently changed devices. It doesn't allow me to login as it keeps saying "incorrect credentials". Even tried the forgot password and it sends no links. I retried to login on my old iphone with the same info and it works perfectly. I even changed the password on my iphone and it works. But it's not allowing me to login on the android with same same credentials error. Is this a common issue for Android?
