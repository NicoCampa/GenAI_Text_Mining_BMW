So now, after getting used to this app, I *seriously* dislike it. I've dropped my rating from two stars to one. The old one was quicker to respond & easier to find what you wanted. Please reinstate support for the old BMW Connected app, so at least we have a choice. Edit: 1 star is unreasonable, it's not useless. But I'm still disappointed, I'll make it 3."

",2021-11-12 14:28:29,1.6.2,English,A very good App that makes me feel more close and connected to my car. It brings a lot of piece of mind knowing that I can view the status of my car wherever I am and even locate it when I'm away on business and checking to see if it's still parked safely at the airport. Very well done BMW!

App says I need to have a subscription enabled but my car has a package with which remote services and others are active permanently.... Have been calling the support for probably two dozen times over the last couple months and it's still not fixed. Definitely doubting if I'll buy another BMW if they can't even get the basic functions of the app to work after months of it being live.

Authentication does not persist as is should. Also, I have set tariffs for charging and the app stores these per charging location, but the app is not good at identifying locations so I now have at least two locations which are in fact the same place. This makes the feature which tracks kWh charged and total cost much less useful as the cost is often missing due to a misidentified ""new"" location."
