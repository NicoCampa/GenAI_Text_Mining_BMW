Mucho peor que la anterior. Además, desde la última actualización, si no permites el acceso a la ubicación, no puedes abrirla. Connected dejaba el fondo en negro y daba información de la presión de las ruedas, cosa sin la que puedo pasar, pero no por tener que permitir acceso a la ubicación. Los mapas también funcionan peor, no sé si han dejado de usar google, pero no encuentra los sitios igual ni tiene todos los que tenía la anterior.
