Most of the time fails to connect to the car. Even if it does, takes ages to get the command over. The interface is laughable. Really BMW, we need to use this app on a daily basis, for the money we pay we expect better than this. EDIT I had to restart the car's operating system yesterday (i4). Today again cannot connect so I cannot set charging parameters and departure time. Our dishwasher has a much better app than this £55k car.",1,0,3.3.1,2023-04-23 18:32:57,,,3.3.1,English,"Abysmal app. Absolutely horrible. Most of the time fails to connect to the car.
