Following support answer here, I sent feedback in the app with my VIN number as well as sent the same question to the email provided here. Unfortunately I never got any reply and the issue is still there. Sorry but this is 0 star service. It's basically the same BMW connected app with a new look, nothing more. Same very limited functions - remote execute climatization, lock/unlock and check charging status. OTA updates not possible for the late year 2019 model 5 as such option is just missing from my car settings, despite I can see an option to check software update for the same model in a showroom and nobody at my local BMW center knows why. Neither BMW connected support.

Also, ich nutze die MyBMW App seit Jahren und bin eigentlich immer zufrieden gewesen. Die Connected Drive Services sind super, vor allem die Routenplanung mit Echtzeit-Verkehrsinformationen und die Ladestationen-Suche. Es ist wirklich ein Segen, wenn man unterwegs ist und schnell eine passende Ladestation findet.

Allerdings gibt es seit kurzem ein Problem: Die Darstellung der verbleibenden Reichweite in der MyBMW App stimmt nicht mehr mit der Reichweite überein, die im iDrive angezeigt wird. Das ist schon ärgerlich, da man sich darauf verlassen muss, dass die Informationen korrekt sind, besonders bei längeren Fahrten. Ich habe schon mehrfach versucht, die App zu aktualisieren und den Cache zu leeren, aber das Problem besteht weiterhin.

Ein weiteres kleines Manko: Die Digital Key Funktion ist manchmal etwas zickig. Manchmal erkennt das Handy das Auto sofort, manchmal braucht es drei Versuche. Das ist zwar kein großes Drama, aber trotzdem nervig.

Insgesamt gesehen ist die MyBMW App aber immer noch eine der besten Apps, die ich kenne, um mein Auto zu verwalten und mit Connected Drive Services verbunden zu bleiben. Ich hoffe, das Reichweitenproblem wird bald behoben. 4 Sterne. 👍

""I've been using the MyBMW App for years and have generally been satisfied. The Connected Drive Services are great, especially the route planning with real-time traffic information and the charging station search. It’s really a blessing when you’re on the road and quickly find a suitable charging station.

However, there's been a problem recently: The display of the remaining range in the MyBMW App no longer matches the range displayed in the iDrive. That's already annoying, as you have to rely on the information being correct, especially on longer journeys. I’ve tried updating the app and clearing the cache several times, but the problem persists.

Another small drawback: The Digital Key function is sometimes a bit temperamental. Sometimes the phone recognizes the car immediately, sometimes it takes three attempts. It’s not a big deal, but still annoying.

Overall, the MyBMW App is still one of the best apps I know to manage my car and stay connected with Connected Drive Services. I hope the range problem will be fixed soon. 4 stars. 👍""",positive,"vehicle status, charging management, digital key/mobile key, ev-specific features, trip planning",ev_hybrid,experienced_user,power_user,yes,no,none

""Also mal ehrlich, was ist hier los? Die App ist ein einziges Chaos. Ständig neue Versionen, jede schlechter als die letzte. Die Verbindung zum Connected Drive funktioniert zwar, aber die Daten sind meistens veraltet oder fehlen ganz. Das Auslesen von Fahrdaten ist eine Geduldsprobe. Die MyBMW App ist ja schon ein Witz, aber das hier ist der Hammer. Das Digital Key Feature ist zwar ganz nett, aber bei weitem nicht stabil genug. Die Integration in iDrive ist auch nur bedingt gegeben. Manchmal funktioniert’s, manchmal nicht. Und dann noch die ständigen Fehlermeldungen. Es wird ständig was versprochen, aber am Ende kommt da nichts dabei raus. Die Ladestationen werden auch nicht korrekt angezeigt. Für eine App von BMW eigentlich unentschuldbar. 2 Sterne, weil sie zumindest teilweise funktioniert, aber das ist zu wenig für das, was man eigentlich erwarten würde.""",negative,"performance, connectivity, vehicle status, digital key/mobile key, updates, charging management",ev_hybrid,experienced_user,power_user,yes,no,none

Ich bin eigentlich ganz zufrieden mit der MyBMW App. Die Integration in Connected Drive funktioniert einwandfrei. Das Anpassen des Fahrzeugs über die App – Licht, Klima, Sättigungszustand der Reifen – ist super praktisch. Auch das Finden von Ladestationen ist ziemlich gut gelungen, obwohl die Darstellung auf der Karte manchmal etwas ungenau ist. Das Speichern von Lieblingsstationen und das Planen von Routen funktioniert einwandfrei.

I'm actually quite satisfied with the MyBMW App. The integration into Connected Drive works flawlessly. Adjusting the vehicle via the app – lights, climate, tire condition – is super practical. Finding charging stations is also quite well done, although the display on the map is sometimes a bit inaccurate. Saving favorite stations and planning routes works flawlessly.

Allerdings finde ich, dass die Digital Key Funktion noch etwas verbessert werden muss. Manchmal braucht sie ewig, bis sie bereit ist, das Fahrzeug zu entsperren. Auch die Darstellung von Fehlermeldungen könnte etwas verständlicher sein. (z.B. ""Fehlercode 423"") Und manchmal stürzt die App einfach ab, vor allem wenn man viele Daten synchronisiert. Das ist natürlich ärgerlich. iDrive ist immer noch besser, aber die App ist ein guter Anfang. 3.5 von 5 Sternen.""

However, I think that the Digital Key function still needs to be improved. Sometimes it takes forever to be ready to unlock the vehicle. The display of error messages could also be a bit more understandable. (e.g. ""Error code 423"") And sometimes the app simply crashes, especially when you synchronize a lot of data. That's of course annoying. iDrive is still better, but the app is a good start. 3.5 out of 5 stars.""",neutral,"performance, remote controls, digital key/mobile key, vehicle status, connectivity, ui/ux, charging management, map/navigation",ev_hybrid,experienced_user,power_user,yes,yes,none

Die App ist grundsätzlich gut, aber leider gibt es einige Probleme. Die Verbindung zum Auto über Connected Drive ist oft instabil und bricht ab. Das ist besonders ärgerlich, wenn man versucht, den Ladezustand anzuzeigen oder eine Ladestation zu suchen. Die MyBMW App ist da manchmal besser, aber auch die hat ihre Macken. Die Darstellung der Fahrzeuginformationen ist oft fehlerhaft oder veraltet. Die Digital Key Funktion funktioniert zwar, aber nicht immer zuverlässig – da habe ich schon öfter Probleme gehabt, das Auto zu entsperren.

Ich bin jetzt seit 1 Jahr BMW Fahrer und nutze die MyBMW App täglich. Was mir am wichtigsten ist, ist die Zuverlässigkeit. Bisher war die App ziemlich stabil, was mir sehr gefällt. Die Connected Drive Funktionen sind gut integriert und funktionieren meistens problemlos. 

Was mich allerdings stört, ist die manchmal etwas langsame Reaktion der App, besonders wenn man versucht, über die App eine Ladung zu starten oder den Status einer Ladestation anzuzeigen. Manchmal dauert es einfach zu lange oder es kommt zu einer Fehlermeldung. 

Auch die Digital Key Funktion ist nicht immer zuverlässig. Manchmal muss ich die App neu starten oder das Handy neu starten, damit sie wieder funktioniert. Das ist natürlich ärgerlich, wenn man schnell ins Auto möchte.

Die Integration ins iDrive System ist gut, aber die App könnte manchmal etwas schneller sein. Hoffe, dass BMW das in zukünftigen Updates behebt. 

Insgesamt bin ich aber zufrieden mit der App und nutze sie gerne. 3 von 5 Sterne. 👍

I've been a BMW driver for a year now and use the MyBMW App daily. What's most important to me is reliability. So far, the app has been quite stable, which I really like. The Connected Drive functions are well integrated and usually work without problems.

What bothers me, however, is the sometimes somewhat slow response of the app, especially when you try to start a charge via the app or display the status of a charging station. Sometimes it simply takes too long or an error message appears.

The Digital Key function isn't always reliable either. Sometimes I have to restart the app or restart my phone for it to work again. That’s naturally annoying when you want to get into the car quickly.

The integration into the iDrive system is good, but the app could sometimes be a bit faster. I hope BMW fixes that in future updates.

Overall, I am satisfied with the app and like using it. 3 out of 5 stars. 👍",neutral,"performance, charging management, digital key/mobile key, connectivity, ev-specific features",ev_hybrid,experienced_user,power_user,yes,yes,none
